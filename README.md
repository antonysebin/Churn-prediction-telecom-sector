# Churn-prediction-telecom-sector
# Telecom company data analysis and churn prediction
*The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition, is the percentage 
of subscribers to a service who discontinue their subscriptions to that 
service within a given time period. For a company to expand its clientele, 
its growth rate, as measured by the number of new customers, must exceed 
its churn rate. The rate is generally expressed as a percentage.*

For this task I chose a telecom company customers churn data set and applied 
several methods for data cleaning, feature engineering and exploratory analysis. 
After understanding main trends and criteria leading to customer churn, 
I tried some popular machine learning algorithms to predict potential 
churners on unseen testing data. For this task I used well-known 
Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Tree-based models, 
KNN, Neural Networks).
